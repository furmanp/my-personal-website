Decided to build my own website to have a semi-professional journal.
I keep this repository public to present that is of my doing, and to keep myself more motivated to keep this going. 
This website is a fork from publicly available theme described in a section below + ruby based static html page generator.

## Klisé

Klisé is minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal site and blog running on Jekyll.<br>
Shout-out to <a href="https://github.com/piharpi/" rel="noopener">piharpi </a> for creating the theme. <br>
Demo available here: <a href="https://klise.now.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">klise.now.sh</a>

## Structure

Website is build using open source static html page generator written in ruby `Jekyll` available <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <br>
Hosted on GitHub in `this repository` and deployed using <a href="https://netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">netlify</a>. <br>
