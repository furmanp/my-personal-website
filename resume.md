# experience
### Pontis Engineering <a href="https://www.pontis-engineering.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@website</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pontis-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@LinkedIn</a><br>
**Composite Design Engineer** <br>
*Jan 2020 – present. Amsterdam, The Netherlands <br>*
Employed for a position of composite design engineer, but nicely tuning in wherever needed. Most of my tasks involve development
of early stage of the project including Finite Element Method analysis, CAD design both parts and tooling. Building prototypes 
using traditional methods or 3D printing is possible. Running laboratory scale testing.

Working for biggest OEM's in Wind Industry, and taking part in development projects of the biggest wind blades in the world.


Recently started to develop range of custom supplementary tools using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). 
I developed number of scripts, commercially for customers and also for internal use. Built on-line interactive
documentation service for improved maintenance and introduced Version Control System. <br>
Exemplary projects are: Layup building tool for DraftSight, 
Custom Toolbar for Siemens Femap, Configuration calculator for composite frames, Office attendance registry. 

My main responsibilities are to create a tangible product or technology from clients requirements or ideas.

**Composite R&D Engineer** <br>
*Jan 2017 – Dec 2019. Cracow, Poland <br>*
Product Development Engineer, responsible for providing manufacturing technology using unique in house developed product,
solid state composite pre-preg. Working closely with chemical department to provide feedback on structural and engineering 
standpoint on the product. Supporting customers on introducing novel technology in their facilities. Running optimisation 
tests to achieve best highest performing part from manufacturing process. 

Designing and delivering tooling used for serial production of composite elements.
Responsible for programming and overseeing production on CNC machine. 
Involved in development new tooling technology using Synthetic Laser Sintering 3D printing method to provide functional 
prototypes in competitively short time due to partial automation of the process. 

Taking part in innovative project to deliver technology for embedding sensors/electronics into composite structure.

### Anpharm Pharmaceutical <a href="https://anpharm.pl/?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@website</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/zak%C5%82ad-produkcyjny-firmy-servier-w-polsce-anpharm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@LinkedIn</a> 
**Postgraduate intern** <br>
*Jul 2016 – Sep 2016. Warsaw, Poland <br>*
Design, manufacturing and programming of automatic diagnosis system for pneumatic circuit of electrostatic counting machine. <br>
The scope of the project was to design detection system of pneumatic pistons wear and tear, without necessity of using high speed camera. 
Degradation of pistons results in wrong number of medication contained in a single package. 
Due to high working speed of the machine it was impossible to easily detect a fault in pneumatic circuit.

Developed system deployed using RaspberryPi was connected the machine motherboard to constantly monitor work of the pneumatic pistons. 
When piston slowed down system was highlighting faulty and informed technicians about the error, indicating particular piston that requires a replacement.

System reduced the machine downtime, and significantly decreased risk of the failure resulting in increase of overall efficiency.

# education
### Warsaw University of Technology <br>
**Faculty of Mechatronics, specialization in Robotics** <br>
Sep 2014 – Feb 2017. Warsaw, Poland <br>
**Masters Thesis:** *Design and development robotic module concept for automatic
collection and distribution of standardized containers.*<br>
Project realized with for an external company <a href="https://versabox.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@website</a>
to design an autonomous system utilizing `Fatboy` transportation platform to handle warehouse space storing medium to small
size items. System consisted of two collaborating units managed by Warehouse Management System. 
One adapted to pick & place operation and second being a transporter and conveyor. Thesis has been concluded with pros & cons 
analysis with consequences summary of investment in such a system.

**Faculty of Mechatronics, specialization in Automation Control** <br>
*Sep 2011 – Feb 2014. Warsaw, Poland <br>*
**Engineering Thesis:** *Identification of mathematical model of inverted pendulum.*<br>
Study focused on identification of mathematical model of the inverted
pendulum, based on the measurements taken on self built laboratory test unit.
Paper presented two methods of verification: based on simulation and on real object readouts.
Simulation studies for identification process were held with use of Matlab/Simulink software. 
The object was created in accordance with mathematical model of inverted pendulum. 
Experiments were conducted on laboratory stand, based on Atmel
microcontroller, constructed especially for the project.

### Technical University Dresden <br>
**Institute of Lightweight Engineering and Polymer Technology, Mechanical Engineering** <br>
*Apr 2015 – Apr 2016. Dresden, Germany <br>*
**Project:** *Design and development of High Voltage Transmission Lines inspection Robot.*
The outlook of the project was to deliver a device which will improve currently existing methods of inspecting transmission lines. 
Aside from being founder of the project I was responsible for a conceptual solution, which was followed by detailed design, 
manufactured and verified on a laboratory scale.
Using composite materials, which were the structural foundation we managed to achieve significantly lower weight, 
compared to different solutions of the same purpose. 

After the Student's Exchange programme ended, my work on the project continued due to potential of commercialization.
The project was finalized winning 1st prize in ENEA+ INNOVATION, contest for the most innovative project that fits into 
business strategy of energy providing company. The contest was of national rank.

# additional activity
### WUT Solar Boat Team
*Apr 2016 - Sept 2016. Warsaw, Poland <br>*
Project focused on building a fully solar-powered 6 meter long boat that will take part in boating race.
Within the team of 10 people we built boat which qualified to worldwide championship, Solar1 Boat Challenge in Monaco.

Boat was built using carbon fiber reinforced composites and aluminum elements, it was powered with solar cells, 980 Watts of 
total power output. In addition to that we developed system of hydrofoils that reduced water resistance increasing maximum speed.


### Robomatic student's association
*Sept 2014 - Mar 2015. Warsaw, Poland <br>*
As a member of student's association while studying at Warsaw University of Technology, I co-organized nationwide tournament 
of mobile robots, Robomaticon <a href="https://robomaticon.pl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@website</a>. 
Tournament gathered over 1000 participants from entire country with several from across the Europe. It attracted attention of around 5000
visitors and public media, taking place in the main hall of WUT.
