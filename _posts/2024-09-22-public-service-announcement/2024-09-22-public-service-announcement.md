When the COVID-19 pandemic hit its peak in 2020, I found myself with plenty of free time than usual due to the fact that 
many of my favourite activities became unavailable. 
With fewer things to occupy myself, I decided to use this extra time to refresh my programming skills.
I started with simple, basic scripts that helped me automate repetitive tasks in both my professional and personal life.

After about a year later, I realized that the work I was doing could be valuable not just for me but for others as well. 
That’s when I decided to document my progress on this website, creating bit of a resume or a personal diary, 
but also hoping that some of the information might be useful to others in the community.

Then, in an unexpected turn of events, in October 2022, I received an offer for a position as a Software Engineer at a mechanical engineering company. 
My role was to automate engineering and design processes within the company and create web-based tools to simplify calculations for our clients. 
I happily worked in that role for almost two years and gained invaluable experience before moving on to my current position as a full-stack engineer at an AI startup.

Even though I transitioned away from the engineering field, my time there made me realize just how much potential the industry has for automation and modern problem-solving approaches. 
For instance, many “hand calculations” in engineering are still done in Excel spreadsheets. While Excel is undoubtedly a powerful tool, 
it’s also prone to errors—simple mistakes like dragging a cell can alter a formula, and the lack of syntax highlighting in the formula bar makes editing cumbersome. 
The reality is that many of these formulas are well-established and rarely change, meaning they could easily be implemented in a web-based app. 
A well-designed app would offer a seamless user experience while reducing the risk of errors, and it could even generate valid reports for users with ease.

More complex engineering calculations, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis, are typically performed using specialized software. 
However, these programs still require a lot of manual work in pre- and post-processing. 
Tasks like defining materials, properties, loads, and constraints take up a significant amount of time. 
For instance, in the composites industry, defining materials and layups can take days rather than hours. 
Automating even parts of this process would lead to significant time savings and reduce the likelihood of human error, which can easily slip through when dealing with such tedious tasks.

Given my experience and passion for automation, I’ve decided to take the next step in my career and establish my own sole proprietorship. 
My goal is to offer automation solutions to companies, particularly in industries where manual processes are still the norm but could benefit greatly from the efficiency and accuracy that modern technology can provide.

I'd be more than happy to discuss the details of your problem.
