After spending several months with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) within the MS Excel environment, I found myself at a crossroads. 
The efficiency VBA provided in automating tasks was undeniable, however I was missing a more modern and flexible programming environment. 
the inability to code outside MS Office programs made VBA less and less attractive and I decided to research solutions that would still allow me to
easily interact with spreadsheet like data structures and having the capabilities of MS Excel while being more convenient for a person without a CS background.

Python programming language has a very strong position in engineering environment as a approachable and pleasant to learn. The most attractive element
is the overwhelming number of libraries containing engineering calculations, which additionally simplifies the process of building automation of mechanical calculations.
Compared to VBA which doesn't have nearly as active community as python and access to aforementioned libraries made me decide to jump ship and dive into the subject.

Next I came across the <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter</a> project. It's an open source
that revolves around the development of the Jupyter Notebooks. Web based application that allows users to create and share documents combining live code, 
equations, plots, and regular text. Combined with Python I found it to be the perfect starting point to step away from Excel based VBA and still
work on engineering automation.
