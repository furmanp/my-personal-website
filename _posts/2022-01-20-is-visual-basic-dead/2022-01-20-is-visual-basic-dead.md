When you go search what programming language you should start learning, visual basic for applications rarely makes it
even to the bottom of the list. But, does it mean it is a dead language?

That obviously depends on, what you want to achieve. I will focus to present my perspective though. Being mechanical 
engineer, where programming is not a first priority knowledge, but rather an auxiliary skill to increase efficiency of certain
areas of work I went through different solutions and frankly, none of them was so useful as VBA [Visual Basic for Application] is.<br>

First of all, I cannot imagine an engineering company that does not have access to the Microsoft Office environment available.
Nowadays, it is a must and VBA, being a product of Microsoft, works seamlessly with almost* all Office applications. Almost, 
because newly released apps like Planner, Teams and Office web Apps does not support VBA at all. It definitely is a downside, 
but not disqualifies other positive aspects. So as long as you are using desktop version of Excel, you do not have anything to 
worry about. 

Speaking of Excel. When trying other languages to support my work, the biggest obstacle was that scripts were running 
perfectly, but on my computer only. I cannot share it with the team without pre-installing them python language or deploying 
executable file which I would rather omit as I wanted to keep the process simple as possible. And that is the part that 
VBA does extremely well. Programming environment is built in, so you can access it directly from Excel. Moreover,
if you want to share your scripts with the team, you simply share a workbook, and they have it up and running in no time.

Another advantage is that majority of engineering software are supporting VBA. Engineering work is often combined with Excel
spreadsheets either way, thus this functionality allows user to improve this connection by automating it the way you need.
Excel only is a powerful tool I cannot imagine working without. I use it to store relevant data about the project which I 
can import or export to CAD or FEM software in no time and effort. <br>
Being fully aware that some languages give incredibly higher performance and advanced libraries to support the workflow I 
stand my ground that for purposes of mechanical engineer, functionality of VBA is more than sufficient. And it is extremely
easy to learn with plenty of resources available online.
